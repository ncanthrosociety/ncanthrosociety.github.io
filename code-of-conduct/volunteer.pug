                    | The NCAS Board of Directors, or any committee of the Board appointed to maintain the
                    | NCAS Code(s) of Conduct.

        h2 Purpose
        p
            | This North Carolina Anthropomorphic Society, Inc. (“NCAS”, also the “Organization”) Volunteer Code of
            | Conduct is in place to ensure that all Volunteers may enjoy our events safely and to foster an environment of
            | mutual trust and respect.

        h2 Scope
        p
            | This Code of Conduct is in effect for any Volunteer of NCAS for any time they are acting as a volunteer for the
            | Organization. This includes both virtual and in-person conduct: 1) while attending any NCAS sponsored or
            | affiliated event and 2) outside of any NCAS sponsored or affiliated event for as long as Volunteer activities are
            | being engaged in.

        h2 Definitions
        p
            | General Volunteer, Volunteer: A (general) volunteer is an individual who has signed up with the Volunteer
            | Coordinator to aid NCAS for a specific event or activity. Such volunteer positions are limited in responsibility
            | and duration, and last only for the duration of said event or activity, potentially including tear-down tasks after it
            | closes to members.

        h2 Additions and Addendums
        p
            | Additional Code(s) of Conduct documents or Event Rules may be applied in addition to or in addendum to
            | regulations in this document depending on the tier of membership or other roles held within NCAS. In such a
            | case as a conflict arises between such documents and this one, the superseding regulation shall be that which
            | is from the most relevant role in regards to the situation or violation. Any questions or uncertainty on what
            | regulation is in effect should be directed to the Policy Contact listed at the beginning of this document.

                      | Department and the Ethics Committee so that we can properly evaluate, monitor and manage
                      | them. If you are not sure if something is a conflict of interest, ask your supervisor, the Risk
                      | Management Department, or the Ethics Committee. A failure to disclose a potential conflict of
                      | interest constitutes a violation of the NCAS Code of Conduct for Volunteers.
