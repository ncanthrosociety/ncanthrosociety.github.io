        h2 Purpose
        p.
            This North Carolina Anthropomorphic Society, Inc. (“NCAS”, also the “Organization”) Vendor
            Code of Conduct Addendum, in addition to the required NCAS Member Code of Conduct, is in
            place to ensure our vendors can profitably enjoy our events safely and to foster an environment
            of mutual trust and respect.

        h2 Scope
        p.
            This Code of Conduct Addendum is in addition to the sections found in the NCAS Member Code
            of Conduct for any Member or Voting Member while acting in any Vendor capacity. This
            includes both virtual and in-person conduct: 1) while attending any NCAS sponsored or affiliated
            event, 2) outside of any NCAS sponsored or affiliated event for as long as Membership is
            maintained.

        h2 Definitions
        p.
            Vendor: A vendor is either a member or an agreed third party permitted to provide products,
            services, or entertainment within a specified event or activity for NCAS and its attending
            members.

        h1 PLEASE DO NOT

        p.
            The following actions are conduct regulation additions and addendums to the NCAS Member
            Code of Conduct relevant for Vendor. These actions and activities are prohibited and constitute
            a violation of the North Carolina Anthropomorphic Society Inc. (“NCAS”) Vendor Member Code
            of Conduct Addendum.
        p.
            Any Vendor found to have committed a violation of these conduct regulations is subject to the
            sanctions outlined in this document. A claim of lack of awareness of any Code of Conduct or
            related procedures does not excuse any violations of such.
