            | NCAS reserves the right to suspend or revoke, without refund, access to event spaces, attendance passes,
            | or even memberships at any level. If any individual violates these regulations, breaks the rules of an
            | NCAS event, or permits or encourages another to do so, they may be barred from the event, from as little
            | as an hour up to the remainder of the event or even subsequent events. If an individual’s access,
            | attendance, or membership is revoked they will be asked to leave any active NCAS event space immediately.
            | If this request is refused or ignored the Organization will contact law enforcement to report criminal
            | trespass and the individual will be banned from any future NCAS event or function.
        p
            | If the individual breaks the law – city, state or federal – they will be reported to the authorities and
            | NCAS will assist those authorities as the Organization is legally able to do so.
