        h2 Purpose
        p.
            This North Carolina Anthropomorphic Society Inc. (“NCAS”, also the “Organization”) Member Code of Conduct is
            in place to ensure that all members may enjoy our events safely and to foster an environment of mutual trust
            and respect.

        h2 Scope
        p.
            This Code of Conduct is in effect for any Member of NCAS for as long they maintain Membership. This includes
            both virtual and in-person conduct: 1) while attending any NCAS sponsored or affiliated event and 2) outside
            of any NCAS sponsored or affiliated event for as long as Membership is maintained.

        h2 Additions and Addenda
        p.
            Additional Code(s) of Conduct documents or Event Rules may be applied in addition to or in addendum to
            regulations in this document depending on the tier of membership or other roles held within NCAS. In such a
            case as a conflict arises between such documents and this one, the addition or addendum shall supersede
            regulations of this document. In such a case as addenda conflict with each other, the superseding regulation
            shall be that which is from the most relevant role in regards to the situation or violation. Any questions
            or uncertainty on what regulation is in effect should be directed to the Policy Contact listed at the
            beginning of this document.
