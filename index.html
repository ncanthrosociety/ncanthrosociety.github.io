(NCAS). We are a nonprofit
organization operating out of Raleigh, North Carolina. Our goal is to organize events for our members
to enrich their lives and give back to the anthropomorphic community throughout the state and
surrounding region.</p><p>We are just getting started here at the NCAS HQ, and are well on our way to begin regular operations.
Our initial goal for 2020 will be hosting a variety of events taking place throughout the year, and
we will be actively exploring additional ways we can contribute to the anthropomorphic community.
Stay tuned for more information about our plans and events in the coming months. Our founders, staff,
and volunteers are excited to be embarking on this journey with you!</p><p>If you are interested in becoming a part of NCAS, or partnering with us, see

the celebration of anthropomorphic activities and culture
by hosting events that engage, entertain, and empower our
members to be a positive influence in our communities and
beyond. We do this because we believe in the openness of
our members, in their passion, in their compassion, and in
the friendships they form.</p></section><section class="section-even" id="teaser"><h1>Coming Soon</h1><p>Have you ever wanted to rent out an entire movie theater for a bad horror movie marathon, or spend a
night around a campfire telling stories with your fellow furries? How about strutting your stuff to
show your pride in fursuit, or volunteering to bring a smile to someone’s day? Well, you’re in the
right place!</p><p>We’re currently hard at work at organizing a variety of exciting events and activities in the North
Carolina area. Whether you’re looking for something indoors or outdoors, a thrilling outing or a
relaxing weekend, we’ll have you covered! Currently, some of the events we are exploring include
daytime gatherings, destination trips with opportunities for sightseeing, and other planned social
activities. And others… might just require a weekend and a hotel.</p><p>Stay tuned, and we look forward to seeing you at our future events!</p></section><section class="section-odd" id="contact"><h1>Contact Us</h1><p>Stay in touch and be informed of our most current news and happenings by liking or following our
