        h2 FAQ

        h3 What is an escape room?
        p
            | An escape room is a team-based experience where members cooperate in a themed room to solve puzzles and
            | challenges that allow the team to escape under a time limit.

        h3 How does an escape room work online?
        p
            | Teams communicate on a zoom call to direct a staff member physically present in the room, telling them
            | where to search and what to do in order to solve puzzles. A browser-based inventory system helps the team
            | see discovered items up-close.

        h3 What do I need to have in order to participate?
        p
            | Participants should have a device with Zoom installed and a reliable internet connection. A device with
            | a web browser is recommended but not required.

        h3 How will I get the link to join the escape room?
        p
            | Staff will e-mail the link to the zoom call to the e-mail address provided with registration in advance of
            | the game. Participants should plan on joining the call 15-20 minutes in advance in order to make sure the
            | link works and in order to familiarize themselves with Fuzzy Logicâ€™s inventory system. In the event of
            | technical issues such as the link not working, NCAS staff members will be on standby to assist.
