            | we will have the entire skating rink AND arcade to ourselves. Fursuits are more than

        h3 What is the Wheels Fun Park?
        p
            | Wheels Fun Park is a roller skating center located in Durham, NC. We have their skating rink and arcade
            | reserved for two hours!

        h3 Is Wheels Fun park fursuit friendly?
        p
            | Yes! They have agreed to let us have fursuits out on the skating rink. We ask that you do not bring tails
            | or other fursuit items that will drag on the floor, because they pose a safety risk to skaters.

        h3 Where is the Wheels Fun Park located? How do I get there?

            | #[a(href='https://goo.gl/maps/16wFFN8XHktbqgys5') 715 N. Hoover Road, Durham, NC 27703]. Wheels has more
            | than one parking lot. See the map below for where you should park!
