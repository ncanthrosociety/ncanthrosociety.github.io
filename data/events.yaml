    Animal Park at the Conservators Center is an educational nonprofit based in North Carolina that is dedicated to
    providing a specialized home for carnivore species. Attendees will receive a tour of the residents (fluffy
    animals) provided by the Animal Park staff.

    You must register for this event. The deadline to register will be December 4th at 11:59pm. We need to give a
    headcount to Animal Park 2 weeks in advance! This means no at the door registration unfortunately.

    Be sure to fill out the Animal Park waiver in advance (link in the header).

    [Friends of Tony](http://webnc.alsa.org/goto/friendsoftony) is a team formed in support and honor of Tony
    “Dogbomb” Barrett, a member of the anthropomorphic community who was diagnosed with Amyotrophic Lateral
    Sclerosis (ALS).

    ALS is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerves in the brain and spinal cord. It slowly robs
    the body of its ability to walk, speak, swallow, and breathe. The life expectancy of a person with ALS averages
    2 to 5 years from the time of diagnosis. The Friends of Tony  are dedicated to aiding the ALS association in
    their goal of bringing hope, raising awareness, and providing resources and services to families affected by ALS
    free of charge.

    Join the Friends of Tony as they walk in memory of Dobgomb on April 18, 2020 at the Raleigh ALS Walk hosted by
    the ALS Association. Check-in is at 08:30 AM, and the walk starts at 10:00 AM. The walk length is 2 miles.
    Fursuits are very much welcome!

    NCAS is proud to present our first event: A trip to the Conservators Center!

    The Conservators Center, Inc. (CCI) is an educational nonprofit based in North Carolina that is dedicated to
    providing a specialized home for carnivore species. Attendees will receive a tour of the residents (fluffy animals)
    provided by the CCI staff. Join us after the tour for a holiday party hosted by NCAS. Drinks and snacks will be
    provided; please feel free to bring a dish of your own to share! We'll also be playing some holiday themed games!
    Yay!

    Have a tacky holiday sweater you want to break out and show off? Then you should participate in our tacky Holiday
    Sweater contest! You'll be able to show off your tackiest Holiday sweater, and win prizes in the process! The top 3
    winners will be awarded prizes! If that doesn't get you excited, we don't know what else will.

    But that's not all! After our tour and holiday party, our friends in the area, the Triad Furs, will be hosting their
    annual holiday party at the Speakeasy Tavern in Greensboro. You will need to register for this event separately,
    but they have graciously invited all NCAS members to come party with them! The event will be catered, and have a
    full bar & bartender.
