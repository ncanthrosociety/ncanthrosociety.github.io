Something Wild - A trip to the Conservators Center!</p><p>The Conservators Center, Inc. (CCI) is an educational
nonprofit based in North Carolina that is dedicated to
providing a specialized home for carnivore species.
Attendees will receive a tour of the residents (fluffy
animals) provided by the CCI staff. Join us after the tour for a
holiday party hosted by NCAS. Drinks and snacks will be provided;
please feel free to bring a dish of your own to share! We'll also
be playing some holiday themed games! Yay!</p><p>Have a tacky holiday sweater you want to break out and show off?
Then you should participate in our tacky Holiday Sweater contest!
You’ll be able to show off your tackiest Holiday sweater, and win
prizes in the process! The top 3 winners will be awarded prizes!
If that doesn't get you excited, we don’t know what else will.</p><p>But that's not all! After our tour and holiday party, our friends
in the area, the Triad Furs, will be hosting their annual holiday
party at the Speakeasy Tavern in Greensboro. You will need to
register for this event separately, but they have
graciously invited all NCAS members to come party with
them! The event will be catered, and have a full bar &
bartender.</p><p>Sound fun? Everything you need to know can be found  below!</p><h2>Details</h2><ul><li>Date: December 21, 2019.</li><li>Time: 1:00 - 4:00 PM EST.</li><li>Location: Animal Park at the Conservators Center,
