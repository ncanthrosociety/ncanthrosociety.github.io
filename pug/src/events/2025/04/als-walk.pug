        h1 Triangle ALS Walk

        p.
            The North Carolina Anthro Society is partnering with the ALS United in their fight to defeat ALS. Our goal
            is to raise $10,000 in support of their mission to serve, advocate for, and empower people affected by ALS
            to live their lives to the fullest.

            Join us for the Triangle ALS walk on Saturday, April 26th, 2025. Fursuits are welcome before, after, and
            during the walk.

        h2 FAQ

        h3 Do I need to donate to walk?
        p.
            No! The walk is open to everyone, but donating any amount is strongly encouraged!

        h3 Are fursuits allowed?
        p.
            Yes! Fursuits are welcome before, during, and after the walk, make sure you are well hydrated through the entirety of the event, and take many breaks as needed. The walk itself will be on a closed public
            road (like a parade). We recommend having a handler with you.

        h3 Can I do anything else to help out?
        p.
            We may need water and some other supplies for fursuiters. Email us at
            #[a(href='mailto:contact@ncanthrosociety.org') contact@ncanthrosociety.org] if youâ€™re interested in bringing
            something. We will also need handlers during the walk to assist fursuiters and carry water.

        h3 Where do I park?
        p.
            Halifax Mall is located in downtown Raleigh. There are public parking areas in the vicinity that will be
            open to use. You should plan on walking a couple blocks after parking.
