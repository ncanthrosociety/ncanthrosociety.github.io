            Have you reviewed our mission statement and love what NCAS is about? Do you want to join us? (We might
            have cookies.) Weâ€™re looking for more like-minded souls that share our values to aid in our quest!

            NCAS is currently seeking more staff volunteers to help out in year-round and event-specific roles. 
            Positions with us are unpaid, and do not have hard schedules or time requirements. However, accepting a 
            staff volunteer position reflects a serious commitment to help NCAS achieve our goals. If you have any 
            questions about how you can help NCAS, our human resources department will be happy to answer them. Send 
            an email to #[a(href='mailto:hr@ncanthrosociety.org') hr@ncanthrosociety.org] and one of our attentive 
            volunteers will get back to you.
        p. 
            As a token of our appreciation, all NCAS staff receive several perks for our conventions:

            Not quite ready to make the leap to being staff? That's fine! We're looking for volunteers too. 
            Volunteering is currently on a per-event basis and applications will be announced on our social media. 
            See #[a(href='/') our home page] for our primary social media accounts.

        p.
            Volunteers for Bewhiskered and Carolina Furfare that go above and beyond will receive gifts of appreciation as a 
            thank you from the convention. While these gifts vary from year to year, they traditionally include a themed gift 
            of some kind, a convention t-shirt, and comped reg for a future convention.
