            | The Conservators Center, Inc. (CCI) is an educational
            | nonprofit based in North Carolina that is dedicated to
            | providing a specialized home for carnivore species.
            | Attendees will receive a tour of the residents (fluffy
            | animals) provided by the CCI staff. Join us after the tour for a
            | holiday party hosted by NCAS. Drinks and snacks will be provided;
            | please feel free to bring a dish of your own to share! We'll also
            | be playing some holiday themed games! Yay!

        p
            | Have a tacky holiday sweater you want to break out and show off?
            | Then you should participate in our tacky Holiday Sweater contest!
            | You’ll be able to show off your tackiest Holiday sweater, and win
            | prizes in the process! The top 3 winners will be awarded prizes!
            | If that doesn't get you excited, we don’t know what else will.

        p
            | But that's not all! After our tour and holiday party, our friends
            | in the area, the Triad Furs, will be hosting their annual holiday
            | party at the Speakeasy Tavern in Greensboro. You will need to
            | register for this event separately, but they have
            | graciously invited all NCAS members to come party with
            | them! The event will be catered, and have a full bar &
            | bartender.
