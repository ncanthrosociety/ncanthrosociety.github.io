            | Organization (WHO).

        h1 Actions you can take
        ul
            li
                | Wash your hands with warm water and soap. This is more effective than hand sanitizer alone.
                | Hand sanitizer is good for temporary use while in public.
            li
                | Avoid touching your face, especially while in public places.
            li
                | Avoid gathering in public places.
            ul
                li
                    | The virus is best spread via respiratory droplets. Distances of 3-6ft and under have increased
                    | risk for transmission. Time is also a factor.
            li
                | Cough into oneâ€™s elbow.
            li
                | Reduce travel if able.
            li
                | Most importantly, if sick, stay home. Seek medical help.
        p
            | We encourage you to follow recommended best practices for social distancing. We know these are difficult
            | times, but our goal is to see everyone remain healthy and happy. As always, this wonderful community is
            | here for anyone that needs help or support.
