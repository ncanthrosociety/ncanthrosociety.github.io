        h1 Dear fellow members of the furry community,
        p
            | We at NCAS have been monitoring the coronavirus (COVID-19) situation that is affecting the country, and
            | we would like to reassure you that we are watching the situation closely and are following all
            | recommendations from sources such as the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the World Health
            | Organization (WHO).
        p
            | It is important that we all take part in the effort to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Here are the steps
            | we are taking.

        p
            | We still plan on holding our convention, Bewhiskered, from October 02-04, 2020. Our staff will continue
            | to monitor the situation closely, and work with the hotel staff to ensure the safety of all members. In
            | the event that it becomes unsafe to hold the convention at that time, we will postpone the convention to
            | a later date.
        p
            | Effective immediately, all other in-person events have been postponed. They will resume once it is safe
            | to do so!

        h1 Actions you can take
        ul
            li
                | Wash your hands with warm water and soap. This is more effective than hand sanitizer alone.
                | Hand sanitizer is good for temporary use while in public.
            li
                | Avoid touching your face, especially while in public places.
            li
                | Avoid gathering in public places.
            ul
                li
                    | The virus is best spread via respiratory droplets. Distances of 3-6ft and under have increased
                    | risk for transmission. Time is also a factor.
            li
                | Cough into oneâ€™s elbow.
            li
                | Reduce travel if able.
            li
                | Most importantly, if sick, stay home. Seek medical help.
        p
            | We encourage you to follow recommended best practices for social distancing. We know these are difficult
            | times, but our goal is to see everyone remain healthy and happy. As always, this wonderful community is
            | here for anyone that needs help or support.
