            | Hello and greetings from the North Carolina Anthropomorphic Society, Inc. (NCAS). We are a nonprofit
            | organization operating out of Raleigh, North Carolina. Our goal is to organize events that enrich the
            | lives of our members and give back to the anthropomorphic community throughout the state and
            | surrounding region.
        p
            | We are just getting started here at the #[abbr(title='North Carolina Anthropomorphic Society') NCAS] HQ,
            | and are well on our way to begin regular operations.
            | Our initial goal for 2020 will be hosting a variety of events taking place throughout the year, and
            | we will be actively exploring additional ways we can contribute to the anthropomorphic community.
            | Stay tuned for more information about our plans and events in the coming months. Our founders, staff,
            | and volunteers are excited to be embarking on this journey with you!
