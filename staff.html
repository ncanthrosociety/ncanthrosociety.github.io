anthropomorphic characters since the late 80's! (Before you say anything, I'm not THAT
old!)  Professionally, I work as a Recruiter, with a background  in Performance and Media
Studies, and Event Planning. Since joining the fandom back in 2011, I have met some
incredibly talented people (or fuzzbutts) that I have the honor of calling friends! Can't
wait to see in helping NCAS grow their events and help put on events you'll be awestruck
by!</p></div><div class="card-footer">Entertainment handles all activities, entertainment spaces, and immersive experiences at an

I’m just your average internet wolf with an occasional presence in the
physical world, although I also sometimes dabble in arcane human activities like science
and computers. And computer science. Joining the community is just about the best thing
I’ve ever done. It has helped me make so many incredible friends over the years, and I
would not be the person I am today without them. I am super excited to be working with
NCAS because it means I get the chance to give back to the community. Let’s go out there
and do great things!</p></div><div class="card-footer">Event administration is responsible for handling the scheduling, manpower, safety, and

fox-husky or a blue accented German shepherd. To me, the best thing about the furry
fandom are the wonderful and supportive people who compose it. I am super excited to do
Guest Relations with NCAS because I hope to continue that tradition of care and support
that I have come to know and love from our  fandom! When I am involved in fuzzy things,
I work towards becoming a physician so I can help all sorts of people. Hope to meet you
soon!</p></div><div class="card-footer">Guest relations is responsible for overseeing the questions, concerns, and needs of guests

I’m a bird initially from Southern California currently nesting in North Carolina.
The furry community there is vibrant and has lots of events. When I heard about NCAS and
learned we share a similar goal, I knew I wanted to be a part of it. Together, we will
help bring cool events to the local furry community. My background is in brand building,
community management, and social media management. If anyone wants to talk shop, squawk

have made some incredible friends and met so many awesome and inspiring people!
Professionally I am a designer and developer by trade, and I also have been DJing for
nearly as long as I've been in the fandom. I am super stoked to be helping establish some
fun events for everyone and to be working with such a great group of folks!</p></div><div class="card-footer">Media production is responsible for the recommendation, planning, and production of all types

event my roommates were working. I went into the weekend only knowing a handful of the
people there, but left after meeting some of the greatest friends I could ask for. When
I was approached to help found NCAS, I was immediately on board with the concept of
having a community that could be a positive influence for all furries. Professionally, I
work in IT, and have an extensive background in customer service and hospitality. I look
forward to leading my awesome team as we move forward with this endeavor and plan for the
future.</p></div><div class="card-footer">Organization operations is responsible for supporting for supporting the long term functions
