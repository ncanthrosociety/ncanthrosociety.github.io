    The NC Anthro Society is proud to bring you Bewhiskered 2021, a convention hosted by the furs of North Carolina
    for furs of all parts of the world. Located in the lovely Marriott at Research Triangle Park, Bewhiskered is in
    the heart of The Triangle and is just a few minutes drive away from the state’s capital and RDU airport.

    Our inaugural theme is “Blast Off” both for the convention’s official debut, and in honor of the 50th
    anniversary of Apollo 13. Come be whisked away by our mascots, Commander Whisky and Flight Engineer Cassie, as
    they prepare to take you on the launch of a lifetime in the only way they know how: a three day weekend full of
    friends, entertainment, and much much more.

    [Friends of Tony](http://webnc.alsa.org/goto/friendsoftony) is a team formed in support and honor of Tony
    “Dogbomb” Barrett, a member of the anthropomorphic community who was diagnosed with Amyotrophic Lateral
    Sclerosis (ALS).

    ALS is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerves in the brain and spinal cord. It slowly robs
    the body of its ability to walk, speak, swallow, and breathe. The life expectancy of a person with ALS averages
    2 to 5 years from the time of diagnosis. The Friends of Tony  are dedicated to aiding the ALS association in
    their goal of bringing hope, raising awareness, and providing resources and services to families affected by ALS
    free of charge.

    Join the Friends of Tony as they walk in memory of Dobgomb on April 18, 2020 at the Raleigh ALS Walk hosted by
    the ALS Association. Check-in is at 08:30 AM, and the walk starts at 10:00 AM. The walk length is 2 miles.
    Fursuits are very much welcome!
